## Folders and files in repo root

- cross-cli: Configs relevant for CLI tools for all operating systems
- linux-cli: Configs relevant for CLI tools for linux and WSL
- linux-wm: Configs relevant for my Linux Desktop Setup
- wsl: self-explainatory: WSL-specific stuff

## What do I need?

Nushell configs require a Nerd Font and Oh-My-Posh

For my Linux Desktop setup refer to `linux-wm/packagelist-linux-wm.txt`

## TODO

- install.sh improvements
- XF86 Keybinds
- maybe some /etc backups
- wofi styling
